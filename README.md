# gamechain-py-examples
Test grounds for Python-based gamechain prototypes and implementations.

####To get started:
Install customized bitcash implementation until updates are available from PyPI

`pip install git+git://github.com/devalbo/bitcash.git#egg=bitcash`

 Use pip to install gamechain from PyPI
 
 `pip install gamechain`
 
 Run `python replay_game.py` - the program will find the GameChain game of tic-tac-toe starting at BCH transaction `qplcu7940lk0hd6at8pgg65wyc98lshk4yrc8uk8jt` and replay it from the blockchain.
